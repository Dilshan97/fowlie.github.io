I was asked to create a website for a family member's company that should display basic company information, it should have a contact me form that would trigger an email and they also wanted to login and edit the content themselves.

Allthough they didn't care about the details of the implementation they had suggested to use Wordpress. My reply to this was that I would help them create the website but not with Wordpress. It's not that Wordpress wouldn't cut it, but I strongly dislike all the extra hassle you have to deal with to keep the site secure and also I had no interest to invest any time into learning a new framework.
