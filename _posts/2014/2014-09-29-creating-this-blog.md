I recently wrote a simple Gradle plugin and shared it on GitHub. Then I though nobody was ever gonna find it. I had to write about it somewhere people read. So to improve my chances, I created my first blog. It's made up of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/), [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and it's hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). So, I don't think I can make it any prettier! Hope you like it! :-) I use [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) to edit the source files.

## Where did I start?

I'm not a designer, but I'm still interested in web design. [This post](http://www.williamghelfi.com/blog/2013/08/04/bootstrap-in-practice-a-landing-page/) was the main inspiration for the design. The background photo is taken by me (a 20 minutes walk from my appartmenet) and it's shows the view of [Drammen](https://goo.gl/maps/Cp2DF).
