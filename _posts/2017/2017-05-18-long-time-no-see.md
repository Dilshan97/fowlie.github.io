Today is the day after celebrating Norway's national day with my girlfriend and our two kids. That's right, we've got two little girls now, aged 0 and 2 years. We're also building a house! :grinning: So that is my excuse to why I haven't written any new posts here since late 2015.

## Future plans
Last time I wrote posts here, I was working for a big insurance company. The department was shut down to be rebuilt in Sweden, but luckily I already had gotten myself another job in the Norwegian Public Roads Administration much closer to where I live. But although I haven't written any new posts here doesn't mean I haven't been doing stuff;

I was asked by my father-in-law to build a website for his up and coming company which is doing really cool VR-stuff, so check out [the final result](https://realtraining.no). I will probably write a long post about how I did it, and the challenges I stumbled upon. But in the meantime I can at least say that I ended up with a Ubuntu 16.04 server from [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com), running [Nginx](https://nginx.org/), [PostgreSql](https://www.postgresql.org) and [Spring Boot](https://projects.spring.io/spring-boot).
