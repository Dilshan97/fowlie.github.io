# My favorite albums

I listen to a lot of music, and I like exploring new styles and genres. In the recent years I've gotten really into 70's progressive rock, but I can listen to any song from any genre as long as it has quality (which most music today lacks). So here are 4 albums that I listen to a lot.

We (me + three old friends of mine) started the band as a tribute to [Creedence Clearwater Revival](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creedence_Clearwater_Revival). We are currently active and we do some traveling and gigging all over Norway (weekends, when we're not in our day jobs).

## Shoot the Breeze

The first real rock band I was in was called Shoot the Breeze. The first full album we released in 2009 called Angels Avenue, produced by guitar legend Ronnie LeTekr√∏ from TNT (remember 10.000 lovers?). Then in 2011 we released another album called Nomadism, this time we did the producing part ourselves. We're not active anymore, but you can still check out our music on Spotify.
